<b>How the Web Works 
</b>

<p>What my take away from this is that the entire web works on some form of HTML.  HTML is one of the languages that computers use to communicate with each other.  The result is a webpage. </p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".

<b>Tags and Elements</b>

<P>Elements help format the text appearing on a page.  For example, Bolding can be done by the element <'b'>.  Elements can also be used for page breaks.  There are many <em><b>elements</b></em> in HTML.  
</P>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>

<P>I personally prefer <b>block</b> to <em>INLINE</em>.  Block helps format the paragraphs neatly while the inline seems more 
  free form.
